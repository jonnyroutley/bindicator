# Bindicator

An app inspired by: [this post](https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/bindicator-device-every-glasgow-home-14738599)

It checks the Oxfordshire bin schedule for a given postcode and address, and sends a push notification (via [Pushsafe](https://www.pushsafer.com)) if the bins need taking out tonight.


.env variables required:
PUSHSAFE="your API key"
